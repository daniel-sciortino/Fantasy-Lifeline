<h1>Welcome to Fantasy Lifeline</h1>

I'm excited to present to you my final project for Concordia's web development bootcamp!

Do you participate in a NHL fantasy hockey pool? Have you ever been unsure of which player you should add/drop? If so, you came to the right place!

Most times Fantasy Hockey pools are created among friends. Finding honest help isn't always easy & that's why i created Fantasy Lifeline.

Simply,

1. Create an account.
2. Select the two players you are undecided about. Post it.
3. Give some time to fellow FantasyLifeLine members to give their advice.
4. Return to profile page to see the results.
5. Don't forget to return the favour! Head over to "Give Fantasy Help" and simply click on the player you think is the better option.
